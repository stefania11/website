Hi! I am Stef. I am currently a Research Scientist in [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) working on novel multimodal AI applications. Previously I was a Principal Researcher in the [Center of Applied AI Research](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/research/center-for-applied-artificial-intelligence) at the University of Chicago. I graduated with a Ph.D. in Creative AI Literacies 🎓 at the University of Washington Information School.

My research focuses on __Large Language Models__ and the design of __Multimodal AI tools__ and resources 🖌️ and during grad school I built the first open-source platform for [K12 AI Education - Cognimates](cognimates.me). When I am not coding & writing papers 👩🏽‍💻 I love trail running, yoga, and riding my 🚲.

I am a former an AI Resident at [X Moonshot Factory](https://x.company/), product engineer at [Fixie.ai](fixie.ai), a [Weizenbaum Research Fellow](https://www.weizenbaum-institut.de/portrait/p/stefania-druga/). An awardee of the [NSF Formal Verification in the Field Grant](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2122950&HistoricalAwards=false) and the [Jacobs Foundation Grant](https://ischool.uw.edu/news/2020/01/researchers-win-fellowship-study-new-frontier-tech-education). I was previously a [LEGO Papert Fellow](https://www.media.mit.edu/posts/meet-the-2017-lego-papert-fellows/) during my time as a master student at MIT researching with Prof. Mitch Resnick and the [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) team.

For more information, please [reach out to me](mailto:stefania@hackidemia.com)! Or have a look at my [papers](https://stefania11.github.io/publications/) or [resume](https://stefania11.github.io/resume/).
